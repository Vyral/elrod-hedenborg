<h1 class="join-us">BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Free Real Estate Agent Training</h5>
<p class="italic">Subscribe to our free agent training newsletter now</p>

<p>Dear clients, friends, and colleagues -</p>

<p>Are you looking for a new career or, if you’re already a real estate agent, to grow your business?</p>

<p>Over the past 10 years we’ve helped over 3,000 Charlotte families buy and sell homes.</p>

<p><strong>The local real estate market this Summer is going to be hot.</strong></p>

<p>There are limited homes for sale with many buyers looking to win the home. This means it’s a great time to sell your home if you want the highest price, but it’s also a great time to help buyers and sellers get it done.</p>

<p>I wanted to write you today not about real estate today, rather we want to help more people get into and succeed in the profession.</p>

<p>So, my big announcement…</p>

<p><strong>I’m inviting you to subscribe now for our free Charlotte real estate training newsletter.</strong></p>

<p>You’ll receive answers to questions about how to grow a rewarding real estate career that's specific to what works locally in our Charlotte market.</p>

<p>You’ll also get a team member interview once a month so you can learn what they are doing to sell homes.</p>

<p>Here’s what agents are saying about the training…</p>

<p><strong>“Wow! You should be a career coach!” - Melanie</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Hearing Thomas' story was really powerful. I can't wait to go all in!” - Bob</strong></p>

<p><strong>“If I can even implement one of these tactics, I could 10x my business.” - Brian</strong></p>

<p>If you’re interested in selling real estate, or you want to improve your current real estate career, here’s what I recommend:
<ol class="indent">

You can also subscribe on our new High Performance Real Estate Mastermind Facebook page.</li>

<li>I’m also holding 3 hour training events from time to time that will help you write your business plan to sell real estate. You’ll learn the same systems we use in our office. Our next event is scheduled for August 2018! Please go here for more info: <a href="http://www.highperformancerealestate.com/agent-events" target="_blank">http://www.highperformancerealestate.com/agent-events</a></li>

<li>If you’re currently a real estate agent, and you need help growing your business, let’s meet one-on-one. It’s a free business planning meeting. I’ll get to know your business and recommend steps for improvement. You can request a free meeting here: <a href="http://www.highperformancerealestate.com/free-real-estate-business-planning-call" target="_blank">http://www.highperformancerealestate.com/free-real-estate-business-planning-call</a></li>

</ol></p>

<p><strong>This is the only message you’ll get from me about any real estate agent training unless you sign up for the newsletter.</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to share it with you only because I know the material can help change a lot of lives both for the agent and the clients they serve here in our Charlotte community.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, I’m here. Just reply to this email or call me at <a href="mailto:info@hprea.com">info@hprea.com</a>.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Lars Hedenborg & Thomas Elrod</p>
