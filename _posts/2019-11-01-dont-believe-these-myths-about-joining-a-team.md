What’s the benefit of joining our team? To answer that question, we’ll answer three common questions that debunk certain myths agents tend to believe about real estate teams:

**1\. Why would I join a real estate team when I could be a solo agent and brand myself?**

Real estate is a tough industry, and the numbers don’t lie: The average agent sells six to eight homes per year. At that rate, if you’re paying a broker and financing your own advertising and administrative support at the same time, there’s no money left to make a decent living as a solo agent.&nbsp;

**&nbsp;2. Why would I only handle one part of a transaction when I can handle all of them?**

In handling one part of the transaction, we take your strength and magnify it so you can do what you do best. Most of the time, this accounts for 20% of the transaction. We have a lot of positions working together (showing specialists, buyer’s agents, listing agents, etc.), and we can put you where you need to be so you can make the income you want and live the life you want.&nbsp;

**3\. Why would I split my commission check when I could keep all of it—wouldn’t I make less money that way?**

This isn’t true at all. When every team member is doing what they do best, each one has the opportunity to earn more take-home money. On top of that, you’re a part of a culture that pushes you to a higher level in your career. At the end of the day, it’s not what you make—it’s what you keep.&nbsp;
