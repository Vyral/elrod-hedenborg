There’s no substitute for a firm grasp of the basics; without them, you can’t reasonably expect to excel in every other area of your profession and become a high-performing, well-rounded agent that outlasts the competition. Here are the four areas you should focus on:&nbsp;

**1\. Get your scripts down pat.** For my first three years in the business, practically all I did was practice my scripts day in and day out. I sold 27 homes in my first 10 months in the business, and 44 in my first full year; this discipline of knowing what to say when speaking with a buyer or a seller over the phone was my X factor.&nbsp;

**2\. Time block.** You have to be ruthless about where you spend your time if you plan to make it in this business. In the greater Charlotte market alone, there are roughly 17,000 agents vying for the attention of buyers and sellers. To survive the first-year dropout rate of 82%, you need to set aside time for the most important activities and train yourself to think in sync with your schedule.&nbsp;

**3\. Get into a cadence.** Just as a rhythm drives a song, it’ll drive your career forward. Plan out what needs to get done every day, week, month, and year. Once you craft a positive routine for each part of your day, stick to it—get into the groove. The first three hours of our day after a rev up and a “Tell me something good” call out, our team spends considerable time in new business development. Identifying new buyers or sellers is critically important for both your short-term success and longevity in the business.&nbsp;

**4\. Become a student of the business.** The reality is that there’s actually very little you learn in real estate school about being a *successful* agent; nobody tells you how to generate leads, time block, or master scripts. Once you have that license in hand, your lifelong journey of learning the nuances of this business begins. Dive deep into every aspect of real estate, as if it were an evolving game that lasts 20 or more years and you’re trying to win. How would you have to act in the first two to three years to set yourself up for success in the next 10 or 15?&nbsp;

Every ‘today’ lays the groundwork for tomorrow—don't waste it. There are plenty of activities associated with the job that don’t make you money, so the goal is to minimize or delegate those activities as much as possible so your time investment gives you the best possible return. Prospecting, lead follow-up, consultations with buyers and sellers, and negotiating contracts are the only things that get you paid.&nbsp;
