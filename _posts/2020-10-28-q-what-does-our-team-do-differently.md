*Here’s how our team’s structure allows agents to produce more.*

&nbsp;

We get this question a lot: What are you guys doing differently? People see agents come into our team and instantly become top producers. The average agent in our market sells six to eight homes per year and handles massive financial transactions less than once a month on average.

We do real estate differently at High Performance Real Estate Advisors. **We put all the systems in place for agents to focus on their 20% and I’m going to run through what that 20% of dollar-producing activities look like today.**

The things that get you paid in this business can be broken down into the acronym P.L.A.N. **It stands for Prospecting, Lead follow up, Appointments, and Negotiating deals.** If you’re doing anything else besides these things, you’re not making the money you should in this business.&nbsp;

We provide strong administrative support. There’s roughly one administrator for each salesperson on our team. Essentially, you’re getting a full-time administrator if you’re an agent on our team. We generate hundreds of leads per month. **We’re not talking junk leads, either.** These are organic leads and clients who actually do want to work with us. We also have inside sales agents who generate leads and set appointments and showing agents who show homes for our agents as well.

**This system is based on the fact that it’s hard to be a real estate agent.** There are easily 12 jobs you need to do if you're working on your own, and it’s very difficult to find success doing them all yourself. Either you’re going to be a jack of all trades, master of none, or you’ll focus on the 20% of activities that will bring you 80% of your business.

As you look at where you’re at in your journey, is your current level of success a function of you being scattered and trying to wear too many hats? If you want to learn more about our team and what a career with us could look like compared to what you’re doing now, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
