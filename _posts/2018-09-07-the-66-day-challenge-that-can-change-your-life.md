Our team is currently in the midst of a challenge that I’d like to discuss with you today.

**It’s a 10-week health challenge** that our team is undergoing together. Every day, we have to drink 66 ounces of water and exercise, along with a couple of other bonus challenges. We’re going to weigh ourselves in, and we’ll get extra points for the percentage of fat that we lose during the course of the challenge.

We’re a couple of weeks in, and **I’m amazed at the camaraderie that I’ve seen on our team** (not to mention the friendly smack-talk). I’ve seen the general office energy and focus increase—and with a market shift looming, agents should take all the focus and energy they can get.

With that in mind, **I’m challenging all my fellow agents to undergo this challenge as well.** I can provide you with a tool to help you plan your challenge and hold yourself (and your co-workers) accountable. The tool consists of a three-page document that asks questions which will force you to think about the goals you have in mind :

What is the one thing you can commit to starting or stopping that will make all the difference in your life?

How will this impact your life when you make this new habit/ritual a part of your daily routine?

What can get in your way of achieving your ‘one thing’?

After you answer those questions, there is a daily chart you can use to track your progress toward reaching the goals you’ve set. Mind you, these challenges don’t have to be about healthy living, they can be about your:

* Spiritual life
* Physical health
* Personal life
* Key relationships
* Business
* Financial life

Whatever it is you’re striving toward, I encourage you to take me up on this challenge. If you stick with it, **you can watch not only your business change, but your life in general as well.**<br><br>If you have any questions or stories about how this challenge has impacted your life, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
