*How are you working with buyers in today’s market?*

&nbsp;

Should you buy a vacation or investment home during the pandemic?

There are obviously many things to consider when it comes to buying vacation or investment properties; the future is still uncertain. But we can say that **interest rates are currently very low,** making a purchase like that much more affordable.

{% include pullquote.html %}

When thinking about vacation homes, **think through the lens of affordability.** What type of loan programs are available to you? How much cash is required for a down payment? Is the cost of this purchase a number you can live with?

There are also a lot of ways to consider investment properties. You might be after cash flow, future appreciation, rate of return, and so on. **Think about what you want to get from the property** to help you determine whether a particular purchase makes sense for you.

So ultimately, it comes down to your personal situation, which is why we like to sit down with our clients and learn about their personal needs.

If you have any questions or would like more personalized advice to help you make this decision, reach out to us today. We’d love to speak with you about your ideas and provide relevant guidance to help you find what you’re after.
