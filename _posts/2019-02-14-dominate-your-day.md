If you want to double (or even triple) your productivity, there is one simple task you should follow: fill out a “Dominate Your Day” document.

This is something our team does each and every day, and it has made a huge difference in how we approach and achieve our goals.

Now, we’d like to challenge you to fill out this document every work day, yourself, for the next 30 days. **You can follow along in the video above to see how this document is formatted.**

The first section of the document contains space to record up to three different projects and the steps involved in each.

Below this, there is a section where you can time block your top six must-do money-making activities for the day. In general, the order and content of these tasks is up to you, but the first two slots should definitely be devoted to business development and lead follow-up. **In total, the six items contained in this section of the document should consume about six hours of your day.**

Finally, the bottom section of the document contains space for an “action item list” and a “positive focus list.” Things on the action item list are important, but, unlike the money-making activities, may not be as highly prioritized as other actions.

The positive focus list is all about listing things that you’re thankful for. Our team follows the motto **“Go B-I-G or go home!” because we believe in Beginning (and ending) our days In Gratitude**

When you stay on track with this Dominate Your Day document for one month, it will be easier to do the same the next month, and then the one after that. Tracking your days using this form can lead to amazing changes in your life and career.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or w[ould like a copy of this document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/HPREA/3+DYD+form.pdf){: target="_blank"}, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
