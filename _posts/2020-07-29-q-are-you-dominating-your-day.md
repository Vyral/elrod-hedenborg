The most successful people do the same things every morning to build momentum early on and dominate their day. Since ours is a high-performance work environment, it’s imperative that our team members each start their day with consistent, positive activities that lend structure and focus. Here is my personal morning routine:&nbsp;

**1\. Get enough sleep.** A great morning actually starts the night before. I’ve found that I need a minimum of 7 ½ hours of sleep every night to fully charge my body and wake up feeling rested and ready.&nbsp;

**2\. Consume water.** We dehydrate when we sleep, so it’s important to fuel our bodies when we get up. If you do nothing else on this list, at least drink 16 to 20 ounces of water right away in the morning—your body will thank you. Along with water, I take a vitamin supplement.&nbsp;

**3\. Drink coffee.** I don’t just make any cup of morning joe; I combine a scoop of Equip vanilla protein powder, a tablespoon of almond butter, and Bulletproof K-cup coffee. It’s about 250 to 270 calories, so I count it as part of my morning meal. I highly recommend this simple coffee recipe because it tastes amazing\!&nbsp;

**4\. Reflect/journal.** I personally sip my coffee while reading my Bible and thinking about my day. If you don’t share a faith, you can still definitely benefit from taking some quiet time to reflect and journal. It’s the perfect time to slow down and think about something bigger than yourself. You can think deeply about what’s working well (or not so well) in your business, ways to strengthen your personal relationships, and your overall life goals.&nbsp;

**5\. Meditate**. I use two apps for this: Headspace (I’m currently in a 30-part series on alleviating stress and anxiety) and Abide (which is a bible app I use to explore scripture and challenge myself to implement more teachings in my life).&nbsp;

**6\. Plan your day.** I follow a very structured process broken down into a three-year plan, a one-year vision, quarterly targets, 30-day goals, weekly commitments, and a daily planning session. Every morning I think about what I’m grateful for and what my intentions are for the day, I say affirmations, and then check out my calendar.&nbsp;

In total, my entire morning routine takes about 60 minutes (45 if I’m really hustling). I have a weekend version that takes between 35 to 45 minutes. Typically, I’ll hit my workout after this routine or plan to hit it later in the day depending on how my schedule looks.&nbsp;

If you’re tired of feeling reactive and flustered in your mornings, I encourage you to go to bed a little earlier. The biggest excuse I hear is this: “Between my spouse and my kids, the day sort of explodes on me and I’m busy as soon as I wake up.” All you need to do is go to bed earlier so you can get up earlier (besides, most of the activities we do past 9 p.m., like watching TV, are not feeding our souls or our personal growth anyways). Ultimately, investing in a solid morning routine comes down to one question: Do you want to live your life at a higher level and see growth in different areas, or would you rather continue to prioritize those things that give you comfort?&nbsp;

Hopefully, my personal morning routine helped you out as an example. If you’re thinking about taking your real estate career to the next level and want to align yourself with a team that can help you focus more on activities that get you paid, go to [highperformancerealestatecareers.com](https://highperformancerealestate.com/careers/). From there, we’ll have a confidential conversation about what that future could look like for you; our agents are selling anywhere from 36 to 48 homes on the low end, while mid-tier agents are selling six to seven per month and our stellar agents hit 10 per month.&nbsp;

Our high-performance environment is definitely not for everyone, but if you’re interested in playing this game at a high level, we invite you to take the next step. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
