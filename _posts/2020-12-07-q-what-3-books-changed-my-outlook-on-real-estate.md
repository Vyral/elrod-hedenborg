*Here are my three favorite books for new and/or struggling agents. *

If you’re brand-new to real estate or find yourself still struggling in this industry, perhaps it’s time to boost your knowledge base. Real estate isn’t easy, and we at High Performance Real Estate Advisors have structured all our systems with that understanding in mind. Today I’m recommending three amazing books that are sure to give you a game-changing new perspective.&nbsp;

The first book I recommend is **“The Compound Effect” by Darren Hardy.** This is one of those timeless reads that will help you achieve goals no matter what industry you’re in, and its message is structured around the central idea of pumping water up a well. It requires a lot of effort to keep pumping water up from deep underground, and determination is key since it will be a while before you can see any results. The good news is, once you start seeing some water flowing at the surface, it won’t take much effort to keep it flowing; if you stop pumping, however, that stream of water immediately seeps back down with no effort at all thanks to gravity, and restarting that flow will be 10 times harder for you. The obvious parallel: Your business development efforts must be *consistent*.&nbsp;

The second read that’s well worth your time is **“Fanatical Prospecting” by Jeb Blunt,** a book about what it takes to succeed at a high level in sales. Though not real estate-specific, it’s one of the most powerful messages given by a high-level sales manager who started at the bottom and reached the top quickly by leveraging an ever-expanding skill set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

My third recommendation is a classic: **“The Ultimate Sales Machine” by Chet Holmes.** Each one of the 12 chapters in this book represents a critical component that every successful agent must have in their business. It covers presentations, marketing, time management solutions with examples of how billionaires balance their time, and much more.&nbsp;

Again, real estate is an ultra-competitive industry, and it takes a lot to be successful in it. It’s not a coincidence that the systems we’ve put in place enable us to sell five, seven, ten, or twelve homes per month while the average agent in our market struggles to muster six or eight properties per year.&nbsp;
