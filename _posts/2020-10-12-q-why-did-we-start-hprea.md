<center><em>Here&rsquo;s the story of how I got into this industry and why we formed our team.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Where did my journey in real estate begin? Well, I left a corporate job and got into the business back in 2007; that, of course, was just before the Great Recession. There’s no sugarcoating the fact that things were pretty gruesome for real estate back then (the end of 2008 especially), but I put my head down and succeeded in a very traditional sense. I sold 44 homes in my first full year, which was stellar production by any standard. The problem, however, is that I was working eight days a week to get those numbers.&nbsp;

I worked all day, weekends, at odd, irregular hours of the night—**I was all in, but I was a slave to the deal with no balance in my life whatsoever.** I needed breathing room, hence the selfish motivation for starting a real estate team. Beyond that, though, I knew that I was good at generating leads and implementing systems to streamline processes and make the job smoother; I realized my systems could also improve the productivity and reduce the stress of agents I brought on to work with me.&nbsp;

**On a team, new agents could achieve phenomenal production&nbsp;without sacrificing their lifestyle&nbsp;**and sanity (right now, we have agents selling 30 to 40 homes in their first year). Once I had my heart set on the team model, I brought on my first administrator and soon after hired several showing agents. I continued building to the point where I could step out of the production circle and allow my team to do all of the production.&nbsp;

That’s the philosophy behind High Performance Real Estate Advisors; we allow agents to their 20%, the thing they’re really good at and will earn the most money possible, and then **we supplement that with amazing technology, administrative support, leads, culture, cadence, leadership, and accountability.** We give you all the ingredients you need to be successful so you can sell more homes in less time without loads of stress.&nbsp;

If you’re at a point in your real estate career where you realize the trade-off between your high production and your lifestyle, family time, or mental health simply isn’t worth it, contact us today. I invite you to visit [highperformancerealestatecareers.com](highperformancerealestatecareers.com) or reach out via phone or email.&nbsp;

There’s more to life than real estate, so don’t let this industry take everything from you; you have the power to achieve the balance you’ve been craving. I hope you found this message encouraging. If you have any questions, I’m never too busy to have a meaningful chat\!
