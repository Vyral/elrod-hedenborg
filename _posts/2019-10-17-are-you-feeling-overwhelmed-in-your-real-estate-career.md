How are you marketing to your database so that your past clients will return to you when it comes time to buy or sell a home? What are you doing to generate referrals?

At High Performance Real Estate, we understand what it takes to do this at a high level. When it comes to generating referrals and keeping in touch with your database there are so many moving parts. **We have over 150 touch-points every year for each one of our clients for life.&nbsp;**

This can be absolutely overwhelming for an individual real estate agent by themselves. &nbsp;If you’re at the stage in your real estate career where it’s becoming too overwhelming—maybe the time you’re investing into the business, the money you’re making, or the stress you’re enduring just doesn’t make sense anymore—**we want to have a confidential conversation with you.**

Go to [highperformancerealestatecareers.com](https://highperformancerealestate.com/careers/){: target="_blank"} and just put in some information about you.&nbsp;

Again, it’s fully confidential. We want to talk about what your business looks like right now, what you think is achievable, and how High Performance can help you bridge that gap. We’ll see you there\!&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, please give us a call or send us an email, we’d love to chat with you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
