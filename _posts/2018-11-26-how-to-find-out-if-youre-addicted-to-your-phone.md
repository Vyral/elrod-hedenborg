We all know the struggle—in this information age, it’s hard to put down our smartphones and get away from the computer. In real estate, spending all our time on our phones not doing anything that adds value to our professional and personal lives can become a real problem. Today I want to discuss **how you can break your habits and grow in your business and in your life.**

Here at High Performance Real Estate Advisors, we openly discuss the things that get in the way of our agents’ potential. My business partner, Thomas Elrod, refers to smartphones as “dream stealers” **because the more time you spend on them, the less time you’re spending on achieving your dreams.** Your cell phone isn’t leading you closer to meaningful goals and dreams and achieving a vision you have for your life.

Darren Hardy has a series called “Insane Productivity,” in which he lays out a [digital addiction assessment](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/HPREA/Addiction-Assessment.pdf){: target="_blank"}. **This is a survey that will show you where you are on the spectrum of phone addiction,** ranging from the lowest score “Clean as a Whistle” to the middle score “Chain Smoker” to the highest score “Perma-Fried.” I found this survey to be very helpful in assessing my own phone usage.

My ultimate point is to **be careful to not become addicted to your technology.** As we say, “Let’s just be better, Charlotte.” Let’s elevate our game and the real estate community so we can serve our clients at a higher level.

If you have any questions for me, please feel free to reach out. I’d love to speak with you
