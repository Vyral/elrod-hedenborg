What’s the secret to growing your real estate business?

Well, truth be told, there’s not actually a secret at all. There are a couple things to do to be successful as a real estate agent:

**1\. Realize that there are only three or four things that will make your money.** Find out which activities are the best in terms of creating business and making income, and then fill your calendar with those dollar-producing activities.<br><br>**2\. Own the fact that real estate is a contact sport.** By ‘contact sport,’ I mean you’ll need to make lots of direct contact with people, even those who might not be looking to buy or sell a home.&nbsp;

To master making contact with clients, there’s a specific question that I’d like to teach you to ask everyone you talk to. In every encounter with a decision-making adult, get out of your comfort zone and ask them the following question:&nbsp;

**“Who do you know that might be looking to buy a home, sell a home, or invest in real estate? Do you know anyone looking for a fast-paced career in real estate?”&nbsp;**

If you can ask that question 15 to 20 times a day or more, you will be radically successful.&nbsp;
