If you want to be the best real estate professional possible, you need to focus not only on your business, but on yourself as well. The best way to do this is by **protecting your energy.** There are around 12,000 real estate agents in the Greater Charlotte area—to set yourself apart, you must bring everything you have to each moment you’re working. Today we’ll be talking about how to maintain your energy so you can perform at the highest level, no matter what the day may bring.

We train our new agents on the same energy-protection concepts I’m about to show you. **You can see the information at (2:05) in the video.**

With the routine, you’ll learn how to keep long-term, high-energy performance levels throughout six areas of your life. **By doing this, some of our agents are able to earn $20,000 to $30,000 each month.** We want you to be able to do the same.
