iBuyers are out there, and they’re causing a “shift storm” in our industry.&nbsp;

However, there’s one thing iBuyers can’t touch, and that’s your database. This means if you don’t focus on your database daily, you’ll lose the battle we’re locked into. What’s the best way to focus on your database? Follow this quick three-step guide:

**1\. Build your database.** You need to be a couple of clicks away from hundreds (if not thousands) of people who know, like, and trust you. There are a lot of simple technology platforms you can use in this regard to get started.&nbsp;

**2\. Communicate with your database systematically.** It’s one thing to have a database; it’s another thing to actually communicate with it.&nbsp;

**3\. Feed your database every day.** It’s not OK to have a bunch of names in your cellphone and think they’re in your database. We use Boomtown for our database, but no matter what technology platform you use, it has to be a place where you can pull up the names of all the people who know you, like you, trust you, and are willing to tell everyone they know that you’re in the business of helping buyers and sellers. You should add two to three new contacts into your database daily.&nbsp;
